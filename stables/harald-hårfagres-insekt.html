      Ask Vedheim had an easier life than his father, at least until his teens. He was like most upper middle class children, he hated school, loved sports (Swimming in particular) and adored Battle Mechs and by extension Mech Warriors, he watched cartoons about them before school every night he found himself playing with miniature models at home, either with his dad or his younger brother Audin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ask didn't notice the Clan invasion, well he noticed how his parents acted differently and how his favourite shows had suddenly started just being re-runs. He was also annoyed that his father would always either be in-front of the TV watching the news or stay late at work...working, he never had time to play anymore. So instead he played with his Brother and had even started teaching his little sister how to play, with very simplified rules and not his finest models.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ask Vedheim was supposed to start Middle School when the Battle happened, and while the battle terrified him he was also happy. His father was finally home and had time to play, and while it was difficult to focus on the game as they could hear the rumble of mechs fighting every now and then, they were relatively safe in their Bunker. Well it was their basement but his dad had told him it was actually a bunker, Ask didn’t really trust his father knew what a Bunker was. Bunkers Ask saw had always been above the ground and had small holes with Machine guns poking out of them, that was a bunker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ask forgot about the game when a Tandem Charge Warhead hit their bunker. Ask forgot about Mech Warriors when his mother and two younger siblings died to an errant SRM. Ask was 13 years old when he became an only child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next decade of his life was harder, he still had to go to school, but now his father had lost his job and made ends meet selling busted mech parts salvaged from after the Battle. Ask now cared more than ever about Battle Mechs and their pilots and had started training to become one, not due to nostalgia or childish wonder, he wished to Pilot a BattleMech so could have a chance to defend what he loves the next time one stomps into his home. His father did not approve at first, but eventually he agreed with his son and showed him what he had been working on, a salvaged LCT IIC. Ask was 16 when his father hired him officially, using the skeleton on a Clan Locust to help his father and his company salvaging lost and forgotten weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent the next five years with his father working, training and still going through his education, but when he turned 21 he had to move out. The Focht War Collage had opened and he was in the first class, and while he dropped out before the class would  officially graduated in the summer of 3062, he was sure his Diploma was in the mail, as he had departed with the blessing of his teacher, to show all of Humanity that Rasalhauge will never stop fighting. Which is why he’s shown up with his Father and Custom made LCT-IIC January 1st 3062 at Solaris.

    <div class='display-4'>Lars Vedheim</div>
    <div class='display-6'>Technician</div>
    <p>
      Lars has lived a life of Conflict, more so than most born in the Inner Sphere. He himself was born in 3021 on tukayyid, and by his first Birthday the Federated Commonwealth had formed, and by his first year in Primary school, he had seen death, as the Lyran Forces’ Operation GÖTTERDÄMMERUNG Follow Up Invasion reached and took Tukayyid, and the 19th Arcturan Guards demolished the local militia, of which Lars’ father was a member.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the Time he was in Secondary school he was no longer a Draconis Combine citizen, but was instead a proud member of the Free Rasalhague Republic and while there was still conflict, there was less of it and he lived a more or less normal life, interested in engineering and cars more than anything. While he’s never married he would spend the next decade and change with Ylva Nakashima, he became a father at the age of 18, the boy was named Ask, after the hardwood tree traditionally used in weapon making.
    </p>
    <p>
      After graduating with a degree in engineering Lars Vedheim worked with several of the minor industrial tycoons on Tukayyid, spending most of his working hours designing more efficient Agricultural machines and his free time building miniature BattleMechs first for and then with his oldest son, he was now the father of three, his sons Ask and Audin as well as his baby daughter Rosalinn. Then the Clans invaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Lars found the pictures in his office not full of scythes, silos and sunflowers, but of Machine Guns, composite armours and Brutal Quotas. What was first thought to be Aliens had suddenly invaded the Inner Sphere, and though it had turned out they were just human, that was somehow worse. Each day the news was of worlds falling to the Clan war machine and for every victory there were two defeats, even as the Houses united in a way they hadn’t done before Amaris, his Home was losing worlds by the day, and all he could do was figure out how to churn out weapons and ammunition out of factories tooled for Agricultural purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lars was 31 years old when the Battle happened. Lars Vedheim was 31 years old when a Tandem-charge SRM hit his house. Lars Vedheim was in the basement, distracting his oldest son as the Battle took place. Lars Vedheim was assembling a Locust-1Vb model with his son as his wife was in the Kitchen of the Bunker below their house. Lars Vedheim was shielding his son with his own body as a Tandem Charge Warhead breached the bunker they hid in and killed his youngest children and the woman he had loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lars Vedheim was a different man after the Battle of Tukayyid, he no longer had a job as the factory he had worked at had been slagged by Lasers and PPC fire, so he made his own job. He started a scrap yard in 3053, one where he and his employees hauled wrecked and forgotten Mechs and scrapped them, selling parts to whoever bought them, and when his son was old enough, he joined in as well. Lars also had a passion project, and after a decade of work it had paid off, every part of an LCT IIC they found was kept and used to assemble one of their own and while they never made an exact replica, they made something better, at least that’s what his son told him. Now with a Clan Mech at their disposal, the now 41 year old Lars Vedheim traveled with his 23 year old son to Solaris, to show the world that Rasalhague will never stop fighting.
