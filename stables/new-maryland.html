      New Maryland is a podunk planet in a podunk part of the periphery, filled with podunk people living podunk lives and dreaming podunk dreams. The ugly brown sparsely populated agrarian planet is unceremoniously wedged between the borders of the Taurian Concordat and the New Colony Region, though neither periphery state considers the planet important enough to court its membership. New Maryland survives almost entirely on its quillar industry, and the height of most people's ambitions is to save enough money to get as far away from the planet as possible.

      Visitors to the planet (few and far between these days) first notice New Maryland's sweet, slightly rotting smell, almost as if the entire planet decided to run a marathon in the heat of summer then just sat stewing in its own juices for a week without even entertaining the thought of maybe taking a shower. Those that aren't chased back into the dropship next notice that the entire spaceport is covered in what looks like bird crap. They are, in fact, completely right. Some of the earliest settlers did import some local Terran flora and fauna, hoping to bring a bit of home along with them to their new world. Unfortunately, the far majority of that wildlife didn't survive the colony's early years. The sole exception turned out to be Columba livia domestica, more commonly known as the rock pigeon. A local variety of insect (which proved impossible to eradicate and in fact turned out to be rather beneficial to soil richness) was the perfect food source for the new invasive species, and within a decade the entire planet was completely covered with the cooing, shitting birds.

      In truth, New Maryland has only one thing preventing it from fading into complete obscurity: The second planet in the system is home to a small, barely functional Jump Station. Constructed by the SLDF a good five hundred years earlier during the Reunification War to aid in their push on the Taurian Concordat, The station (somewhat pathetically named the 'Hope of Maryland' by its podunk citizens) services a small amount of jumpship traffic each year, mostly from semi-illegitimate traders traveling between the Concordat and New Colonies and hoping to avoid the attention of the nearby Aurigan Coalition in the process. Local farming consortiums beg, plead, and bribe visiting dropship captains to buy enough quillar exports to keep them in business another year.

      In April of 3060, as part of a planet wide initiative seeking to revitalize their image and promote the local quillar industry, the New Maryland Department of Agriculture hired Reed Conway as their new VP of marketing. Hired for his sole qualification of not being a New Maryland native, Conway quickly took charge, and a weeklong binge of parties, meetings, HPG messages and backroom deals ensued. It wasn't until the dust settled that they fully realized what they had done. The New Maryland Department of Agriculture had spent their entire advertising budget for the next decade on a Solaris VII stable.
