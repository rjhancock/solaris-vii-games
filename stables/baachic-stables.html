      Owner: Ms. Rayna Fawkes
    </p>
    <p>
      Newly established by the Kalidasa-based trader and financier Rayna Fawkes, Baachic Stables has rented a compound in Montenegro and nominally flies the Marik flag in terms of rooting interest. Ms. Fawke’s ultimate loyalty, however, is to commerce. She hopes to use the team to strengthen her trading connections to Kali Yama Weapons Industries back home, and to forge new connections with Solaris- based manufacturers and sports memorabilia merchants which she can trade in the thriving bazaars of Kalidasa. She is certainly willing to spend money to succeed on Solaris, but expects that those she hires will spend that money to gain the maximum effect. As such, she has stated her intent to buy particularly durable `Mechs for her stable “to keep them in the fight earning me money and out of the repair bay, costing me money.”

    <p>
      Given her profit-driven motivations, it comes as no surprise Rayna has chosen to hire Afshan Visvayu as a manager. Visvayu had been building a reputation as a logistical wizard, shepherding a series of two bit outfits to surprising success out in the smaller arenas of the Reaches, culminating in a run in Branson Brewery League. The move up to the big leagues was the next logical step, and while fans and the press are sometimes less than enamored with their reserved and aloof demeanor in pre-match press conferences, investors are very much enamored with their calculating and efficient asset management.

      Azzie came up with Mx. Visvayu, where she has recently won several charity free for alls and other exhibition matches in the ramshackle Class Two circuit of the Branson Brewery League in Xolara. There, her crack gunnery, calm under fire, and ability to drink people under the table won her eht nickname “Asclepius,” because “... she’ll cure what ails ya!” Some odds makers suggest she could still use another year of seasoning in the Reaches, but with Afshan Visvayu headhunted for Baachic Stables, both manager and warrior were able to convince Ms. Fawkes not to break up a successful partnership. Azzie has been affecting a confident and braggadocious tone in preseason interviews, though whether this is compensating for her laconic manager, a shrewd marketing tactic, true egotism from being called up too early, or some combination of all three remains to be seen.

      Zinger is a former Kali Yama test pilot who Ms. Fawkes hired on the outbound trip to Solaris, and who has been charitably described as “a warmly sarcastic minor pain in the ass” by someone willing to be quoted in the tabloid media only as “her friend.” While Fawkes hired Fara under a clear understanding that the stable would need another pilot at some point for redundancy, the stable bringing on Azzie Klassen, and manager Visvayu clearly intending Azzie as the stable’s #1 warrior, seems to have come as somewhat of a disappointment for Ms. Ismaili, who signed on to become a Solaris star and looks instead to be back to her old role of calibrating weapons and testing systems while others win the glory. So far, this has mostly manifested in good natured verbal sniping with her teammate, but it doesn’t take a genius dirtsheet reporter to see that Zinger is aching for a chance to prove herself in the limelight.

    <p>
      Raf Miranda was another hire Ms. Fawkes made for the fledgling stable before leaving Kalidasa, but he manifestly does not share Rayna and Fara’s connection to Kali Yama. Instead, he signed on after being recently fired from Kalidasa’s other major military industrial concern: the notorious Quickscell Company, which listed “chronically exceeding repair standards and inducing attendant cost overruns” as the reason for Raf’s termination from their weapons testing arm.  One gets the impression the termination may have been intentional, as Raf got his start in a myomer workshop at Earthwerks Keystone, where he had nothing but positive performance reviews. With his time at Earthwerks and firing from Quickscell both serving as sterling references to the meticulous quality of Raf’s work, Ms. Fawkes was happy to hire the wayward mechanic looking to put several light years between himself and his previous employment.
