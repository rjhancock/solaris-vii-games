      School of 天下無敵 !<br />
      The Winds of the Xin Sheng !<br />
      Tikonov!<br />
      St. Ives!<br />
      North Wind!<br />
      Behold!<br />
      Your Sons and Daughters of Capellan are burning red!
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The embers of the Capellan Confederation are now a full flame. The reborn Star League under the founding First Lord Sun Tzu have stopped the clan menace and the Capellan Confederation has found a new rebirth Xin Sheng! bringing in prosperity and warmth to the people. However there are worlds that have still left in the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Sun Tzu stepped down as first lord, the Ministry of Social Education and Ministry of Military wished to bring the message of hope that is the Xin Sheng movement to their former HQ worlds (St.Ives and Tokonov respectively)
    </p>
    <p>
      The Solaris Games and its vast viewership in the Federated Commonwealth that covered many former Capellan worlds taken during the 4th Succession was the perfect place for the message. Selecting prospects from MechWarrior families that stayed loyal after their units betrayed the Confederation in the 4th Succession, the aim of the stable is to provide heroes for the people on former  Confederation worlds and to stoke the embers in their hearts to a roaring flame that will engulf their worlds and rejoin the burning beacon of hope for humanity, The Capellan Confederation!

      The oldest of the pilots selected, Sang-wei Arseny Sabovich was born on Tikonov in the city of Kolcha. Descended from a family of MechWarriors loyal first to the Capellan people. The Sabovich family fled with the 4th Tau Ceti Rangers after the fall of Tikonov in the 4th Succession War and resisted the call to join the Tikono Free Republic. For the Sabovich family’s loyalty to the Capellan state and helping the the 4th Tau Ceti Rangers in their retreat, Arseny was sponsored by the mercenaries and Tikoov nobility still loyal to Capella to go to the Capella War Collage. Arsney graduated and joined the Red Lancers and served in Operation Bullog. Though Arseny’s company was not selected to fight in the Great Refusal, he served with distinction in the Operation and upon returning was offered an instructor position at the Liao Conservatory of Military Arts. When the search for pilots from lost Capellan worlds started, Arseny was the first approached for lead pilot and to pick pilots to build a stable that would have no equal under heaven.

      Anthony Callahan has lived with the shame of the Northwind Highlanders betrayal of the Capellan Confederation for all his life. Having descended from the Callahan Clan that had a home in the 2nd Kearny Highlanders Regiment. Lil’ Tony, as his grandfather would call him, would be regaled with stories of how the 2nd Kearny Highlanders hunted down the treacherous Gladstone Gladiators in the Succession Wars for breaking their contract with the Capellan Confederation and the Battle of New Aragon, where the 1st and 2nd Kearny Highlanders held off five separate assaults from the Infamous Wolf Dragoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      However all these stories ended with a pained look on the elderly Callahan as he would end every story of the betrayal of hundreds of years of loyalty for a piece of land none of the other Highlanders had set foot on and the pain of having to leave all his family behind to stay as the last of the Callahans to fight for the Capellan people at their greatest hour of need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the elder Callahan and his family had been treated well and lauded as heroes who stayed to help the Capellan people, Anthony always felt the same shame his grandfather had held in his heart. Attending the Liao Conservatory of Military Arts and graduated top of his class, Anthony had choice of any command to join. However, his seifu, the instructor Arseny Sabovich chose him for his skill and his passion to show that the Callahan name meant honour and dedication to the people they protected.

      Ming Yuen had the oddest route to the Laio Conservatory of Military Arts as he was a servitor for 5 years before being accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ming Yuen came from populous world Texlos in the St Ives pact, where he was orphaned young in the slums in the shadow of the shining cities of Texlos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ming Yuen decided early to join the Tong underworld and find his fortune in the IS underworld rather than be part of the countless face people in the Texlos slums were the only other way out was joining the St Ives Armoured Cavalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      However on his first smuggling run with low level Tongs into Capellan space smuggling illegal holovids, his group were captured by Red Lancers on a training expedition. While most of the crew was summarily executed for crimes against the Capellan people, the underage smugglers were given a chance to serve the Capellan people by being servitors for the Red Lancers as batmen for the officers and MechWarriors.
    </p>
    <p>
      This introduced Ming Yuen to Arseny Sabovich who Ming Yeun served under. Batting for his officer, Ming Yeun received in return an education and mentoring missing from his early childhood. At the end of 5 years of Servitor status, having had the honour of serving the Red Lancers and being one of the few technically civilian Inner Sphoids to have stepped on the Clan Home Worlds, Ming Yuen was given a place in the Laio Conservatory of Military Arts where status mean less than other older and more prestigious academies.
    </p>
    <p>
      An older brother to his fellow classmate Anthony Callahan, who would constantly bother the older Ming Yeun of stories of Operation Bulldog and the Red Lancers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the mission to Ming Yuen as a fine example to the St Ives Compact of the uplighting nature of the Capellan system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ming Yuen felt more an obligation to his mentor and father figure Sabovich and his friend Lil’ Tony. Now under the stadium lights on the Game World Solarius, Ming Yeun finally feels truly have become his own man and left the slums of Texlos behind.
