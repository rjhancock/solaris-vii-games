    <p>
      Khaled’s Killers (Formerly Mayhew’s Mayhems) is a new stable to Solaris; born from a destroyed mercenary company ruined fighting on the Liao front in the service of the St. Ives Compact. Pieter Mayhew, the current MRBC license holder, and Jaasim Khaled are the only survivors of that campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Established in late 3061 using the remaining funds from the mercenary company’s contract bonds and escrow accounts and making use of a salvaged Raven, the stable has nevertheless been able to secure an excellent technician in Jaimee Hickman.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a new stable, entering a new tournament made sense – with the MegaMek Invitational announced and open for entry, the last of the stable’s funds went to buying in and acquiring the necessary competition licenses for the light ‘mech circuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stable holds a strong Davion alignment and anti-Capellan sentiment runs deep in the current staff. What little advertising and sponsorship they have gained so far is firmly from companies originating in Davion or Steiner space.

      Pieter Mayhew hails from the FedSuns world of DeWitt, a hot industrial world to the galactic north of New Avalon by a few jumps. Born the third son of a family which owned a major industrial ‘mech factory, Pieter was expected to carry on the family business after university.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, he used stolen money from the family trust fund and the skills gained piloting industrial ‘mechs to buy his way off planet to Galatea, signing on with a small mercenary outfit bound for the contested border worlds of the St. Ives Compact
    </p>
    <p>
      Pieter won’t say exactly what happened when he was fighting Liao forces, beyond that he and Jaasim were the only two survivors of the contract and that they made it away with a salvaged RVN-4X. What is clear however is his hatred of Capellans and a desire to show their backed stables that the FedSuns can still make their lives hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now on Solaris, the de facto CO of a defunct mercenary company, and with the last of his funds Pieter has taken on a new gamble: founding a stable to compete in the new MegaMek Invitational tournament. He is proud of his time with the merc’s though and still wears the dress tunic of a junior lieutenant for his press conferences on Solaris.

      Jaasim Khaled is a quiet MechWarrior from the St. Ives Compact, picked up by Pieter Mayhew’s former mercenary unit during their contract there. He remains as tight-lipped as Pieter about the events which caused the destruction of the unit and if questioned further he’s just as likely to react with a punch to a reporter’s nose as he is to walk away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dispossessed, and without anywhere to go, Jaasim travelled to Solaris with Pieter. He hopes that, by fighting for the stable and building a reputation he might eventually get back in the command chair of a ‘mech and fight for fame and glory of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is quick to anger and sullen and is an unknown quantity as far as disciplined control of a BattleMech goes. Jaasim is young however and has something to prove; he hopes it’s enough to be the makings of a future Solaris great.

      Jaimee is the odd one out in Mayhew’s Mayhems, and she likes it that way. An expert tech who learned her craft with the FedCom military during the Clan Invasion, if there’s something she doesn’t know about teching; “It’s not worth knowing”. Jaimee is no stranger to Clan salvage either. Born on Solaris, she understands the harsh realities of the competition circuits on the games world and can provide expert advice. For a fee.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her service with the military ended, she returned to her birth world as a tourist, using her demobilisation payout to bankroll dreams of becoming a professional gambler.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few years later and with more changes of identity and loan sharks shot in back alleys than she cares to count, the fast talking tech has signed on with Mayhew’s Mayhems as a way to start fresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Provided she can keep her focus on the job in hand and doesn’t get swept back into her old life, she’ll keep the stable’s ‘mechs running better than they did when they came out of the factory.    </p>
