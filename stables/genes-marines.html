      <em>Gene realizes he doesn't get to transfer his pension after 23 years in the Navy</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Gene was in the Navy, which is the laughing stock of the entire military branch. Suffering from budget cuts and even mass layoffs, Gene was the director of this small military branch. However, after the Lyran Commonwealth cut is pension, which was his entire retirement plan, Gene filed a lawsuit and wasted away the rest of his money. Realizing the only way to be able to retire was to win it big in Solaris, Gene created Gene’s Marines, funded by his military friends and a go fund me page. Gene’s Marines is a new stable, new to the scene, with really no reputation and not many funds. But Gene’s military network has convinced many of his previous colleagues to join him, such as Avalanche, their mechtech.
