      The Quad Kings Stable has been around for a few decades, but until it came under new management, it was something of a joke among the other stables.  Run under drunk managers and having only one overworked tech, few people knew about it until Centaur, a veteran gladiator and showgirl, bought it up and fired all the drunk pilots, and brought a Tarantula her tech could actually fix up. Hasina, the tech, turned out to be an incredibly gifted tech when under proper management: between the two of them, they’ve caused quite a stir in the Solaris rings, though most of it is undeserved: the massive maneuverability Spasmatius can demonstrate is scary, but like all light 'Mechs it is fairly fragile.

      The stable is known for being easy going and in it for the sport rather then any political position, though they do have ties in Canpious for branding and sponsorship deals, plus a stock of parts for the cyber legs Centaur uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      They only dislike one group: the Word of Blake is a menace in their book, though the stable still plays fair, even against them.

      Alsoda, or Centaur as she’s better known, hails all the way from Canpious IV, and is known for two things: one, she’s one of the best pilots with quads around, and after an early injury in a gladiator match cost her both legs, she got two new sets: one being a centaur like lower half for PR and showboating, the other being the two normal legs she uses for fitting into mech cockpits. Her custom mech Spasmaticus (a modified Tarantula 1A) is used by her intuitively thanks to her practice with the centaur legs, meaning she can pull off manuevers most would only dream of.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Centaur is a three year veteran of the Solaris league, and is mostly out for herself and her newly acquired stable, though she hates the Word of Blake for taking over the scene. Given the chance, she’d boot them off world herself.

      Hasina hails from Canopus, coming from a long line of mechtechs.  Unfortunately, her initial plan to intern on Solaris took a turn when her teacher died in an accident: lacking the funds to return home to her family, she did her best to make ends meet, becoming self-taught in the ways of the IS mech.  Her fortunes improved when Centaur took over the stable, and she believes she owes Centaur a great debt… and the c-bills coming her way certainly are appreciated.
