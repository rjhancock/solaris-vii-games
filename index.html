    The year is 3062; it has been ten years since the Clan Invasion of the Inner
    Sphere and tensions are building once again. The Federated Commonwealth is on
    the verge of civil war, the Draconis Combine launches a renewed offensive
    against Ghost Bear. Elsewhere, the Word of Blake grows in strength.

    On the game world of Solaris however, despite nationalist riots, the
    tournaments continue. This glittering play world is the home of the great
    Solaris Games, where thousands flock to watch BattleMechs beat the living hell
    out of each other for their entertainment.

    These gladiatorial matches between the titans of the modern battlefield are
    the centre of attention; MechWarriors, whether down on their luck or just
    itching for some action and money, are drawn like moths to a flame, as are
    fans and tourists from across the Inner Sphere.

    Fortunes are won and lost, reputations built on fame or infamy, and for
    many it can become a way of life.

  What you'll find here are the rules, leader boards, and bios of all the
  participants from the various seasons we intend to have. As for how
  the battles will be partaken, if you are local to your opponent, you
  can opt for good old table top. If not, we recommend using
  <a href='https://megamek.org'>MegaMek</a> (currently recommend 0.48).
</p>

<p>
  Be sure to check out the <a href='/rules.html'>rules</a> to see how
  we are running this and check back often as our first season begins
  soon.
