title: Rules of the Games
toc: true

These rules are designed to allow players to become Solaris stable masters,
building their reputation, wealth, and an arsenal of BattleMechs, weapons,
and the warriors to pilot them. These rules will work best as a PVP
experience with a GM and are intended for use with the
[MegaMek and MekHQ](https://megamek.org) Java apps.

The rules should support any number of players, but an even number will
work best to ensure the ladder is split correctly.

The rules are intended for creating a ‘zero to hero’ story, starting
from the light ‘mech class and working up, but players may choose to start at a
higher weight class if their player group agrees and will have enough
participants for the ladder.

They should however be usable on the tabletop and may be possible to be played
against 'Princess' included in MegaMek. When playing against the bot, players
may create multiple stables and assign these to the bot, or simply give the AI
random 'Mechs in their chosen weight class.

## Creating A Stable

### Solaris Stables

Whilst a rare few MechWarriors have the means to buy their way into Solaris as a
sole performer, the majority will join a stable. These rules put the players as
the owner of a stable of their own creation, as well as controlling their
MechWarriors during matches. The stable will often be the owner of the ‘Mechs
used, the license holder for the weight class to be competed in, and the repair
and maintenance facilities needed to maintain them.

Stables are responsible for paying the upkeep and salary costs of all their ‘Mechs
and pilots, as well as any repair costs for damage sustained in the arena. Wise
stable masters will keep a reserve of money to pay for any repairs!

### Standard Stable Creation

Each players’ stable will start in the Light BattleMech division. Only BattleMechs
falling into the light weight class may be used, with a maximum tonnage of 35 tons.

### Starting Budget

Each stable will start with a budget based on the weight class they are
competing in. All Stables start in the Light weight class and will progress
as the season moves forward.

| Weight Class | Starting Budget |
|:---:         | :---:           |
| Light        | 5,000,000       |
| Medium       | 10,000,000      |
| Heavy        | 15,000,000      |
| Assault      | 20,000,000      |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

### Purchase ‘Mechs

Players start by purchasing one BattleMech of their choice. The purchase price
used should be that listed on the [Master Unit List](http://masterunitlist.info).
‘Mechs must be of a standard design/omni configuration available in 3062.

Clan ‘Mechs may be purchased, but the MUL price should be increased by 1.25 to
reflect their rarity. Due to the nature of Solaris arenas, LAMs may not be used.

### Purchase Pilots

Players may purchase up to 3 pilots at stable creation. A starting stable should
include no more than 3 pilots.

Be as creative as you like with your pilot names and call-signs, as well as
custom portraits! Feel free to add as much background for your pilots as you want.

The total price of a pilot should be worked out by combining the cost of the
Gunnery and Piloting skills listed in the table below:

| Gunnery | Cost    | Piloting  | Cost    |
| :---:   | :---:   | :---:     | :---:   |
| 6+      | 25,000  | 6+        | 10,000  |
| 5+      | 50,000  | 5+        | 30,000  |
| 4+      | 100,000 | 4+        | 80,000  |
| 3+      | 250,000 | 3+        | 200,000 |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

### Pilot SPAs

Any pilot with either a gunnery or piloting score of 3+ may purchase one
special ability from the below list, at an additional C-Bill cost:

| SPA                         | Cost      |
| ---                         | :---:     |
| Natural Aptitude: Gunnery   | 1,000,000 |
| Natural Aptitude: Piloting  | 800,000   |
| Cluster Hitter              | 250,000   |
| Dodge                       | 100,000   |
| Hopping Jack                | 150,000   |
| Hot Dog                     | 100,000   |
| Manoeuvreing Ace            | 100,000   |
| Melee Master                | 400,000   |
| Sandblaster                 | 350,000   |
| Some Like it Hot            | 100,000   |
|Weapon Specialist            | 500,000   |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

### Edge

Each pilot starts with 1 edge point.

### Purchase Technical Staff

Each BattleMech in a stable must have a dedicated tech assigned.
Techs are purchased using the following table:

| Skill | Cost    |
|:---:  |:---:    |
|6+     | 50,000  |
|5+     | 75,000  |
|4+     | 150,000 |
|3+     | 300,000 |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

Any tech with a skill of 3+ may purchase ‘Clan Tech Knowledge’ for an
additional cost of 500,000. Clan Tech Knowledge is used to reduce the
repair and maintenance costs for 'Mechs incorporating Clan technology.

### Customize ‘Mechs

Once a ‘Mech, pilots, and a technician have been purchased, remaining
funds may be used to customize the ‘mech to the player’s liking.

Solaris is known for seeing weird and wonderful custom BattleMech
designs; any 'Mech may be customized to use a mixed-tech base.

All parts must be available on or before 3062.

Parts are purchased at their market value.

Clan tech parts are purchased at their market value x 1.25.

### Alternative Stable Creation (Choosing a weight class)

These alternative creation rules allow the player to choose a weight class to
start in. These are:

* Light
* Medium
* Heavy
* Assault

Aside from the starting budget, all standard rules for stable creation apply.

## Solaris Tournaments & Matches

Each Solaris weight class has its own tournament, as well as the Solaris Grand
Championship. This section covers the rules for playing a Solaris tournament,
their matches, and any special rules which players should use.

### Honour System

These rules are very much dependent on players sticking to an ‘honour system’
as far as match outcomes, repairs, and costs are concerned. Play nice and play
fair!

### Setting up a Tournament

A tournament should have an even number of players. If the tournament has a GM,
they can also be a player but must remain impartial!

If a player group does not have an even number of players, use the Princess bot
to provide an opponent at the appropriate stage in a ladder, or the GM may
provide an opponent.

If using MekHQ, the start date of the tournament should be set to 01/01/3062.

Each player should have their own MekHQ save file for their stable.

### Conceding during a Match

Players may concede at any point during a match to minimize repair costs or
to prevent pilot death. When conceding, the player should indicate this to the
other competitors and shutdown their ‘mech. Financial penalties for early
concession are handled in the post-match stage.

### Seed Match

Once each player has created their stable, seed matches should be set up.
Pilots cannot die or sustain injuries in the seed match, and all damage is
repaired for free after the seed match.

If a tournament contains multiple weight classes, each weight class should
have its own seed match.

Players may not concede during a seed match.

A seed match must have a minimum of 4 stables taking part and no more than 16.
Each seed match is a free-for-all deathmatch. There is no turn limit on a seed
match.

A seed match should contain an even number of players and is used to determine
the starting ladder for the tournament. Each player should bring one mech of
the appropriate weight class.

A seed match should take place in an arena-style map. Map size is up to the
players, but suggested values are as follows:

| Number of Players | Number of Map Sheets |
| :---:             | :---:                |
| 4                 | 1                    |
| 6 - 8             | 2                    |
| 10 - 12           | 3                    |
| 14 - 16           | 3                    |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

The seed match ends when only one ‘mech is left alive.

### Creating the Ladder

A season should be broken up into a series of matches, defined by the ladder.
This ladder will diverge into two ladders as the season progresses, creating
a Championship ladder and a Runners-Up ladder.

The ladder should be created based on the results of the seed match. Each group
of 4 players should be broken into a leg of the tournament and paired with
another player for their first match according to the below:

| Seed Placement | First Match Partner |
| :---:          | :---:               |
| Winner         | Third Place         |
| Second Place   | Fourth Place        |
| Third Place    | First Place         |
| Fourth Place   | Second Place        |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

Once initial games have been fought, winners should be recorded on the ladder
(using a shared spreadsheet or other tool). The winner of each match will fight
each other next and the ladder stages will continue to shrink until two players
remain to fight for the grand championship of their weight class.

Those who lost both their initial matches will play each other on the
‘Runners-up’ ladder in their own championship.

Those who lose matches on the championship ladder after the first round may join
the runners-up ladder if their GM allows, or they may choose to follow the rules
for ‘Players without a ladder position’.

### First Leg Free-for-all (Alternative)

Some players may want to have larger matches at the start of the ladder. In this
case, if all players on that leg of the ladder/the GM agrees, they may play their
game using the same format as the seed match, but with the rewards listed for a
regular match.

### Players without a ladder position

Players without a ladder position i.e. those who have lost twice do not need to
worry about not being able to play games or advance their stable. Players without a
ladder position are free to play as many exhibition or team matches as they wish for
the rest of the season and receive rewards for these exhibition matches.

### Alternative for groups of players not in multiples of four

Where a group of players is not evenly balanced in multiples of four, the total number
of players can be divided by two instead. This will create ladder groups of three or
five. In these ladder groups, players will need to play multiple matches more akin to a
football/soccer league.

GMs may wish to devise a points system for promotion to the next leg.

A suggested points system is as follows:

| Result | Points |
| :---:  | :---:  |
| Win    | 3      |
| Draw   | 1      |
| Lose   | 0      |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

### Stables with Multiple ‘Mechs

A stable with multiple ‘Mechs in its line-up is free to switch between ‘Mechs for each
match. For example, a stable with two ‘Mechs might choose to alternate them between each
ladder match or based on knowledge of their opponent.

### Ladder Timescale

Each rung of the tournament ladder takes 1 in-game week to play. For example, if we assume
that 01/01/3062 is a Monday, the first leg would end on Sunday 07/01/3062.

It is recommended that each leg also encompasses approx. 1-2 weeks of real-time as well, to
give all players time to get their games in as well as schedule any exhibition matches.

The time it takes to complete all the matches in a ladder is called a season. Season lengths
will vary depending on player group size.

## Special Matches

### Friendly/Exhibition Matches

Only one exhibition match may be played per week, per player, unless they are without a current
ladder position.

A player may choose to play an exhibition match with any other player on the ladder, no matter
their position or seeding. The other player must agree to the match.

An exhibition match is a one-on-one deathmatch, fought until one player’s mech is destroyed, or
a player concedes.

Exhibition matches have no impact on ladder position.

### Team Matches

Only one team match may be played per week, unless the players are without a current ladder
position. This is in addition to any exhibition matches scheduled.

A team match is played between multiple stables, or between two stables who can field equal
numbers of ‘Mechs. Teams should have even numbers of ‘Mechs on each side.

Team matches have no impact on ladder position.

### Grudge Match

Only one grudge match may be played per week, no matter whether a player has a
current ladder position or not. To schedule a grudge match, a stable must have a
pilot with 5 grudge points against another MechWarrior.

Grudge matches are always a one on one. The other player must accept the grudge match.

### Playing the Match

Matches should be played on an appropriate map representing a Solaris arena. The existing
Solaris maps packaged with MegaMek may be used, or GMs/players may use random maps
between 1-2 map sheets in size.

### Pilot KO

The vital signs of any MechWarrior competing in Solaris are closely monitored by the
stable’s med-team. As a result, any pilot with three or more hits who falls unconscious
will automatically concede the match.

A player who’s pilot has two hits or fewer or falls unconscious may choose to concede,
or may choose to keep the pilot in the match in the hope they return to consciousness.

Any pilot unconscious for three consecutive rounds automatically concedes.

### Fifty-Fifty

If both players manage to destroy the others ‘mech in the same turn, this is a fifty-fifty.
In this case, the match is called as a draw. Both players receive the participation reward
as well as the kill bonus. The match should then be rescheduled for a re-fight.

### Board Edges

If a ‘Mech flees the board from an edge, or is forced off a board edge by a charge attack or
death from above displacement, it is considered to have conceded.

If the ‘mech was forced from the board by a charge attack or DFA displacement before round 5,
its stable does not pay the early concession penalty.

### Ejected Pilots/Pilots outside of ‘Mechs

Sometimes, a pilot may be forced to eject from their 'Mech – either by ammunition explosion or
other catastrophic damage. If the match is a 1v1, the match ends due to 'Mech destruction. If
the match is a team match or a free-for-all regular match early in the ladder, pilots are
likely to be on the board and in danger.

If a 'Mech intentionally targets, either with shooting or melee attacks, an ejected pilot this
is considered to be bad sportsmanship. Financial penalties in the form of life/medical
insurance will be paid by the stable who’s ‘mech injured/killed the pilot.

### Turn Limits/Draws

For a regular match, there is no turn limit, but if neither player has killed the other’s
mech by turn 20, they may choose to call the match a draw, or go into ‘sudden death’.

In sudden death, the first mech to achieve a hit through armour (i.e. damaging structure)
on the opposing mech wins.

If the match is called as a draw, the match must be rescheduled and re-fought.
