title: Rules of the Games
---
These rules are designed to allow players to become Solaris stable masters,
building their reputation, wealth, and an arsenal of BattleMechs, weapons,
and the warriors to pilot them. These rules will work best as a PVP
experience with a GM and are intended for use with the
[MegaMek and MekHQ](https://megamek.org) Java apps.

The rules should support any number of players, but an even number will
work best to ensure the ladder is split correctly.

The rules are intended for creating a ‘zero to hero’ story, starting
from the light ‘mech class and working up, but players may choose to start at a
higher weight class if their player group agrees and will have enough
participants for the ladder.

They should however be usable on the tabletop and may be possible to be played
against 'Princess' included in MegaMek. When playing against the bot, players
may create multiple stables and assign these to the bot, or simply give the AI
random `Mechs in their chosen weight class.

## Creating A Stable

### Solaris Stables

Whilst a rare few MechWarriors have the means to buy their way into Solaris as a
sole performer, the majority will join a stable. These rules put the players as
the owner of a stable of their own creation, as well as controlling their
MechWarriors during matches. The stable will often be the owner of the ‘Mechs
used, the license holder for the weight class to be competed in, and the repair
and maintenance facilities needed to maintain them.

Stables are responsible for paying the upkeep and salary costs of all their ‘Mechs
and pilots, as well as any repair costs for damage sustained in the arena. Wise
stable masters will keep a reserve of money to pay for any repairs!

### Standard Stable Creation

Each players’ stable will start in the Light BattleMech division. Only BattleMechs
falling into the light weight class may be used, with a maximum tonnage of 35 tons.

### Starting Budget

Each stable will start with a budget of 5,000,000 C-Bills.

### Purchase ‘Mechs

Players start by purchasing one BattleMech of their choice. The purchase price
used should be that listed on the [Master Unit List](http://masterunitlist.info).
‘Mechs must be of a standard design/omni configuration available in 3062.

Clan ‘Mechs may be purchased, but the MUL price should be increased by 1.25 to
reflect their rarity. Due to the nature of Solaris arenas, LAMs may not be used.

### Purchase Pilots

Players may purchase up to 3 pilots at stable creation. A starting stable should
include no more than 3 pilots.

Be as creative as you like with your pilot names and call-signs, as well as
custom portraits! Feel free to add as much background for your pilots as you want.

The total price of a pilot should be worked out by combining the cost of the
Gunnery and Piloting skills listed in the table below:

| Gunnery | Cost    | Piloting  | Cost    |
| :---:   | :---:   | :---:     | :---:   |
| 6+      | 25,000  | 6+        | 10,000  |
| 5+      | 50,000  | 5+        | 30,000  |
| 4+      | 100,000 | 4+        | 80,000  |
| 3+      | 250,000 | 3+        | 200,000 |

### Pilot SPAs

Any pilot with either a gunnery or piloting score of 3+ may purchase one
special ability from the below list, at an additional C-Bill cost:

| SPA                         | Cost      |
| ---                         | :---:     |
| Natural Aptitude: Gunnery   | 1,000,000 |
| Natural Aptitude: Piloting  | 800,000   |
| Cluster Hitter              | 250,000   |
| Dodge                       | 100,000   |
| Hopping Jack                | 150,000   |
| Hot Dog                     | 100,000   |
| Manoeuvreing Ace            | 100,000   |
| Melee Master                | 400,000   |
| Sandblaster                 | 350,000   |
| Some Like it Hot            | 100,000   |
|Weapon Specialist            | 500,000   |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

### Edge

Each pilot starts with 1 edge point.

### Purchase Technical Staff

Each BattleMech in a stable must have a dedicated tech assigned.
Techs are purchased using the following table:

| Skill | Cost    |
|:---:  |:---:    |
|6+     | 50,000  |
|5+     | 75,000  |
|4+     | 150,000 |
|3+     | 300,000 |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

Any tech with a skill of 3+ may purchase ‘Clan Tech Knowledge’ for an
additional cost of 500,000. Clan Tech Knowledge is used to reduce the
repair and maintenance costs for `Mechs incorporating Clan technology.

### Customize ‘Mechs

Once a ‘Mech, pilots, and a technician have been purchased, remaining
funds may be used to customize the ‘mech to the player’s liking.

Solaris is known for seeing weird and wonderful custom BattleMech
designs; any `Mech may be customized to use a mixed-tech base.

All parts must be available on or before 3062.

Parts are purchased at their market value.

Clan tech parts are purchased at their market value x 1.25.
