title: Rules of the Games

* Base List
{:toc}

These rules are designed to allow players to become Solaris stable masters, building their reputation, wealth, and an arsenal of BattleMechs, weapons, and the warriors to pilot them. These rules will work best as a PVP experience with a GM and are intended for use with the [MegaMek and MekHQ](https://megamek.org) Java apps.

When using MegaMek/MekHQ, a MegaMek [rules configuration file](/seasons/1/SolarisSeason1Preset.xml). A [map pack](/seasons/1/MegaMek_Invitational_-_Map_Pack_1.zip) is also provided, with special rules provided for each map.

The rules should support any number of players, but an even number will work best to ensure the ladder is split correctly.

The rules are intended for creating a ‘zero to hero’ story, starting from the light ‘mech class and working up, but players may choose to start at a higher weight class if their player group agrees and will have enough participants for the ladder.

They should however be usable on the tabletop and may be possible to be played against the Princess bot included in MegaMek. When playing against the bot, players may create multiple stables and assign these to the bot, or simply give the AI random `mechs in their chosen weight class.

These rules have been designed, and are continually being revised by, UlyssesSockdrawer.

## Creating A Stable

### Solaris Stables

Whilst a rare few MechWarriors have the means to buy their way into Solaris as a sole performer, the majority will join a stable. These rules put the players as the owner of a stable of their own creation, as well as controlling their MechWarriors during matches. The stable will often be the owner of the ‘Mechs used, the license holder for the weight class to be competed in, and the repair and maintenance facilities needed to maintain them.

Stables are responsible for paying the upkeep and salary costs of all their ‘Mechs and pilots, as well as any repair costs for damage sustained in the arena. Wise stable masters will keep a reserve of money to pay for any repairs!

### Multiplayer Stables

If the player group/GM agrees, multiple players may control one stable. Not every stable must be a multiplayer one.

One player must be designated the ‘Stable Master’ and is responsible for the administration and management of the stable. All other players are ‘Pilots’ and will control a MechWarrior in the stable.

A multiplayer stable must buy as many MechWarriors as it has players at stable creation.

A multiplayer stable starts with the standard budget for its weight class.

### Standard Stable Creation

Each players’ stable will start in the Light BattleMech division. Only BattleMechs falling into the light weight class may be used, with a maximum tonnage of 35 tons.

### Starting Budget

Each stable will start with a budget of 5,000,000 C-Bills.

### Purchase ‘Mechs

Players start by purchasing one BattleMech of their choice.

The purchase price used for ‘Mechs may be sourced from MekHQ, the [Master Unit List (MUL)](http://masterunitlist.info), or from any source books. The choice for which price source should be used should be decided by the GM/the players at the outset.

‘Mechs must be of a standard design/omni configuration available in 3062.

Clan ‘Mechs may be purchased, but the MUL price should be increased by 1.25 to reflect their rarity.

Due to the nature of Solaris arenas, LAMs may not be used.

### Purchase Pilots

Players may purchase up to 3 pilots at stable creation. A starting stable should include no more than 3 pilots.

Be as creative as you like with your pilot names and call-signs, as well as custom portraits! Feel free to add as much background for your pilots as you want.

The total price of a pilot should be worked out by combining the cost of the Gunnery and Piloting skills listed in the table below:

| Gunnery | Cost    | Piloting  | Cost    |
| :---:   | :---:   | :---:     | :---:   |
| 6+      | 25,000  | 6+        | 10,000  |
| 5+      | 50,000  | 5+        | 30,000  |
| 4+      | 100,000 | 4+        | 80,000  |
| 3+      | 250,000 | 3+        | 200,000 |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

### Pilot SPAs

Any pilot with either a gunnery or piloting score of 3+ may purchase one special ability from the below list, at an additional C-Bill cost:

| SPA                         | Cost      |
| ---                         | :---:     |
| Natural Aptitude: Gunnery   | 1,000,000 |
| Natural Aptitude: Piloting  | 800,000   |
| Cluster Hitter              | 250,000   |
| Dodge                       | 100,000   |
| Hopping Jack                | 150,000   |
| Hot Dog                     | 100,000   |
| Manoeuvreing Ace            | 100,000   |
| Melee Master                | 400,000   |
| Sandblaster                 | 350,000   |
| Some Like it Hot            | 100,000   |
|Weapon Specialist            | 500,000   |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

### Edge

Each pilot starts with 1 edge point.

### Purchase Technical Staff

Each BattleMech in a stable must have a dedicated tech assigned.

Techs are purchased using the following table:

| Skill | Cost    |
|:---:  |:---:    |
|6+     | 50,000  |
|5+     | 75,000  |
|4+     | 150,000 |
|3+     | 300,000 |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

Any tech with a skill of 3+ may purchase ‘Clan Tech Knowledge’ for an additional cost of 500,000. Clan Tech Knowledge is used to reduce the repair and maintenance costs for 'Mechs incorporating Clan technology.

### Customize ‘Mechs

Once a ‘mech, pilots, and a technician have been purchased, remaining funds may be used to customize the ‘mech to the player’s liking. Solaris is known for seeing weird and wonderful custom BattleMech designs. Follow the section of rules for ‘BattleMech Customization’ for this step.

### Alternative Stable Creation (Choosing a weight class)

These alternative creation rules allow the player to choose a weight class to start in. These are:

* Light
* Medium
* Heavy
* Assault

Aside from the starting budget, all standard rules for stable creation apply.

### Starting Budgets

Starting budget is dictated by the weight class chosen:

| Weight Class | Starting Budget |
|:---:         | :---:           |
| Light        | 5,000,000       |
| Medium       | 10,000,000      |
| Heavy        | 15,000,000      |
| Assault      | 20,000,000      |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

## BattleMech Customization

Whilst many of the ‘Mechs which take part in duels on Solaris VII are left in their standard configurations, still yet more are customized and tweaked by their stable or pilot to eke out any advantage possible in the arena.

This section details the rules and restrictions on ‘mech customization.

### Parts Costs

BattleMech parts for configuration are purchased using the value listed in MekHQ.

Clan tech parts are purchased at their market value x 1.25.

### Saving Configurations and Reverting to Stock Configuration

At any point, and for no cost, a ‘mech may be reverted to its stock configuration.

A player may have up to three alternate configurations per BattleMech. The parts for each configuration must be purchased separately.

There is no cost saving for sharing parts between configurations. Each new configuration must pay the full market price for each ‘mech part used.

There is no cost to switch between configurations.

If a player already has three saved configurations for a ‘mech, one must be discarded before a new configuration can be made for the ‘mech.

If a configuration is discarded, no costs are recouped from the sale of parts.

### Allowed Parts

All parts must be available on or before 3062.

In a standard game, all parts used must not exceed the ‘Experimental’ technology level.

Unofficial parts may only be used with GM/player group approval. This includes the use of dual cockpits.

### Disallowed Parts

Unofficial parts in a standard game.

Parts only available after 3062.

**The following weapon types are disallowed:** Artillery/Indirect

**The following ammunition types are disallowed:** Fuel Air, FASCAM/Thunder, Smoke

## Solaris Tournaments & Matches

Each Solaris weight class has its own tournament, as well as the Solaris Grand Championship. This section covers the rules for playing a Solaris tournament, their matches, and any special rules which players should use.

### Honour System

These rules are very much dependent on players sticking to an ‘honour system’ as far as match outcomes, repairs, and costs are concerned. Play nice and play fair!

### Setting up a Tournament

A tournament should have an even number of players. If the tournament has a GM, they can also be a player but must remain impartial!

If a player group does not have an even number of players, use the MegaMek Princess bot to provide an opponent at the appropriate stage in a ladder, or the GM may provide an opponent.

If using MekHQ, the start date of the tournament should be set to 01/01/3062.

Each player should have their own MekHQ save file for their stable.

### Conceding during a Match

Players may concede at any point during a match to minimize repair costs or to prevent pilot death. When conceding, the player should indicate this to the other competitors and shutdown their ‘Mech. Financial penalties for early concession are handled in the post-match stage.

### Seed Match

Once each player has created their stable, seed matches should be set up. Pilots cannot die or sustain injuries in the seed match, and all damage is repaired for free after the seed match.

If a tournament contains multiple weight classes, each weight class should have its own seed match.

Players may not concede during a seed match.

A seed match must have a minimum of 4 stables taking part and no more than 16. Each seed match is a free-for-all deathmatch. There is no turn limit on a seed match.

A seed match should contain an even number of players and is used to determine the starting ladder for the tournament. Each player should bring one mech of the appropriate weight class.

A seed match should take place in an arena-style map. Map size is up to the players, but suggested values are as follows:

| Number of Players | Number of Map Sheets |
| :---:             | :---:                |
| 4                 | 1                    |
| 6 - 8             | 2                    |
| 10 - 12           | 3                    |
| 14 - 16           | 3                    |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

The seed match ends when only one ‘mech is left alive.

### Alternate Seed Match Sizes

If, due to scheduling issues, or lack of availability, a seed match cannot contain an even number of players, they may contain an odd number.

In this case, seeds should ideally be in multiples of three, and ‘play-off’ matches added to the ladder. A play-off match acts as a regular match but should be fought in the same week as the first round of matches to allow all players to stay in sync.

### Creating the Ladder

A season should be broken up into a series of matches, defined by the ladder. This ladder will diverge into two ladders as the season progresses, creating a Championship ladder and a Runners-Up ladder.

The ladder should be created based on the results of the seed match. Each group of 4 players should be broken into a leg of the tournament and paired with another player for their first match according to the below:

| Seed Placement | First Match Partner |
| :---:          | :---:               |
| Winner         | Third Place         |
| Second Place   | Fourth Place        |
| Third Place    | First Place         |
| Fourth Place   | Second Place        |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

Once initial games have been fought, winners should be recorded on the ladder (using a shared spreadsheet or other tool). The winner of each match will fight each other next, and the ladder stages will continue to shrink until two players remain to fight for the grand championship of their weight class.

Those who lost both their initial matches will play each other on the ‘Runners-up’ ladder in their own championship.

Those who lose matches on the championship ladder after the first round may join the runners-up ladder if their GM allows, or they may choose to follow the rules for ‘Players without a ladder position’.

### First Leg Free-for-all (Alternative)

Some players may want to have larger matches at the start of the ladder. In this case, if all players on that leg of the ladder/the GM agrees, they may play their game using the same format as the seed match, but with the rewards listed for a regular match.

### Players without a ladder position

Players without a ladder position i.e. those who have lost twice do not need to worry about not being able to play games or advance their stable. Players without a ladder position are free to play as many exhibition or team matches as they wish for the rest of the season and receive rewards for these exhibition matches.

### Alternative for groups of players not in multiples of four

Where a group of players is not evenly balanced in multiples of four, the total number of players can be divided by two instead. This will create ladder groups of three or five. In these ladder groups, players will need to play multiple matches more akin to a football/soccer league.

GMs may wish to devise a points system for promotion to the next leg.

A suggested points system is as follows:

| Result | Points |
| :---:  | :---:  |
| Win    | 3      |
| Draw   | 1      |
| Lose   | 0      |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

### Stables with Multiple ‘Mechs

A stable with multiple ‘Mechs in its line-up is free to switch between ‘Mechs for each match. For example, a stable with two ‘Mechs might choose to alternate them between each ladder match or based on knowledge of their opponent.

### Ladder Timescale

Each rung of the tournament ladder takes 1 in-game week to play. For example, if we assume that January 1, 3062 is a Monday, the first leg would end on Sunday January 7, 3062.

It is recommended that each leg also encompasses approx. 1-2 weeks of real-time as well, to give all players time to get their games in as well as schedule any exhibition matches.

The time it takes to complete all the matches in a ladder is called a season. Season lengths will vary depending on player group size.

## Special Matches

### Play-Off Matches

A play-off match will happen when a tournament’s number of players is not a multiple of four, or where odd-sized seed matches have been needed due to scheduling issues.

A play-off match is treated as a regular ladder match for all rewards and renown received.

If two players are required to play a play-off match, they may only schedule one additional match that week (either an exhibition or a team match), rather than being able to schedule both types of special matches in a week.

### Friendly/Exhibition Matches

Only one exhibition match may be played per week, per player, unless they are without a current ladder position.

A player may choose to play an exhibition match with any other player on the ladder, no matter their position or seeding. The other player must agree to the match.

An exhibition match is a one-on-one deathmatch, fought until one player’s mech is destroyed, or a player concedes.

Exhibition matches have no impact on ladder position.

### Team Matches

Only one team match may be played per week unless the players are without a current ladder position. This is in addition to any exhibition matches scheduled.

A team match is played between multiple stables, or between two stables who can field equal numbers of ‘Mechs. Teams should have even numbers of ‘Mechs on each side.

Team matches have no impact on ladder position.

### Grudge Match

Only one grudge match may be played per week, no matter whether a player has a current ladder position or not. To schedule a grudge match, a stable must have a pilot with 5 grudge points against another MechWarrior.

Grudge matches are always a one on one. The other player must accept the grudge match.

### Playing the Match

Matches should be played on an appropriate map representing a Solaris arena. The existing Solaris maps packaged with MegaMek may be used, or GMs/players may use random maps between 1-2 map sheets in size.

### Map Selection

If using MegaMek and the provided map pack, roll 1d6 and pick the corresponding map number for the match e.g. a roll of 6 would have the match take place at the Steiner Colosseum.

Roll for any special conditions set for the map in the rules document included with the map pack.

### Pilot KO

The vital signs of any MechWarrior competing in Solaris are closely monitored by the stable’s med-team. As a result, any pilot with three or more hits who falls unconscious will automatically concede the match.

A player whose pilot has two hits or fewer or falls unconscious may choose to concede, or may choose to keep the pilot in the match in the hope they return to consciousness.

Any pilot unconscious for three consecutive rounds automatically concedes.

### Fifty-Fifty

If both players manage to destroy the others ‘mech in the same turn, this is a fifty-fifty. In this case, the match is called as a draw. Both players receive the participation reward as well as the kill bonus. The match should then be rescheduled for a re-fight.

### Board Edges

If a ‘mech flees the board from an edge, or is forced off a board edge by a charge attack, or death from above displacement, it is considered to have conceded.

The player who initiated the charge or DFA attack receives the financial rewards and pilot renown for winning via a melee kill.

If the ‘mech was forced from the board by a charge attack or DFA displacement before round 5, its stable does not pay the early concession penalty.

### Ejected Pilots/Pilots outside of ‘Mechs

Sometimes, a pilot may be forced to eject from their ‘mech – either by ammunition explosion or other catastrophic damage. If the match is a 1v1, the match ends due to ‘mech destruction. If the match is a team match or a free-for-all regular match early in the ladder, pilots are likely to be on the board and in danger.

If a ‘mech intentionally targets, either with shooting or melee attacks, an ejected pilot this is bad sportsmanship. Financial penalties in the form of life/medical insurance will be paid by the stable who’s ‘mech injured/killed the pilot.

### Turn Limits/Draws

For a regular match, there is no turn limit, but if neither player has killed the other’s mech by turn 20, they may choose to call the match a draw, or go into ‘sudden death’.

In sudden death, the first mech to achieve a hit through armour (i.e., damaging structure) on the opposing ‘mech wins.

If the match is called as a draw, the match must be rescheduled and re-fought.

## Post-Match/Inter-match results & administration

### Seed Match Rewards

Seed match rewards are calculated as follows:

| Position                  | Reward  |
| :---                      | :---:   |
| Winner                    | 100,000 |
| 2nd Place                 | 50,000  |
| 3rd Place                 | 25,000  |
| 4th Place (5th if needed) | 10,000  |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

For seed matches larger than four players, divide the total number of players by four to get the results.

E.g., for a seed match of eight players, there would be two groups of four. For a seed match of six players, there would be a group of four and a group of two, or this could be split into two seeds of three.

#### Rewards for groups not in multiples of 4

Follow the rules for seed matches not in multiples of four and assign rewards as per the table above.

### Special Match Rewards

Participants in an exhibition or team match should work out their total rewards from the below table:

| Condition                               | Reward   |
| :---                                    | :---:    |
| Participated                            | 100,000  |
| Won                                     | 150,000  |
| Sole Survivor (Team Match Only)         | 100,000  |
| Kill Bonus (Shooting)                   | 50,000   |
| Kill Bonus (Melee)                      | 75,000   |
| Conceded before round 5                 | -50,000  |
| Intentionally targeted an ejected pilot | -120,000 |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

For a grudge match, all prizes are multiplied by 1.5 due to the high-stakes and interest from the crowd. This is calculated before the weight-class modifier.

These rewards are additive, so a player who participated and won the match would receive a prize of 250,000 C-Bills.

The sole survivor bonus may only be claimed in a team match. It may only be claimed when a ‘mech is the only ‘mech remaining, or to have not conceded, at the end of a team match.

### Regular Match Rewards

Regular matches are the highlight of the Solaris season and contribute to the players’ ladder rankings. As a result, these draw the highest rewards from broadcasting rights, merchandising, and ticket sales.

Rewards are calculated as follows:

| Condition                               | Reward   |
| :---                                    | :---:    |
| Participated                            | 250,000  |
| Won                                     | 500,000  |
| Kill Bonus (Shooting)                   | 100,000  |
| Kill Bonus (Melee)                      | 125,000  |
| Conceded before round 5                 | -50,000  |
| Intentionally targeted an ejected pilot | -120,000 |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

### Quarter-Final, Semi-Final, and Final Match Rewards

The quarter-final, semi-final, and final matches of a season are huge affairs, drawing in massive crowds and huge viewing figures. Stables reaching this level of competition are well rewarded.

Rewards are calculated as follows:

| Condition                               | Reward    |
| :---                                    | :---:     |
| **Quarter-Final**                       |           |
| Participated                            | 500,000   |
| Won                                     | 750,000   |
| Kill Bonus (Shooting)                   | 100,000   |
| Kill Bonus (Melee)                      | 125,000   |
| Conceded before round 5                 | -50,000   |
| Intentionally targeted an ejected pilot | -120,000  |
| **Semi-Final**                          |           |
| Participated                            | 750,000   |
| Won                                     | 1,000,000 |
| Kill Bonus (Shooting)                   | 150,000   |
| Kill Bonus (Melee)                      | 175,000   |
| Conceded before round 5                 | -50,000   |
| Intentionally targeted an ejected pilot | -120,000  |
| **Final**                               |           |
| Participated                            | 1,000,000 |
| Won                                     | 3,000,000 |
| Kill Bonus (Shooting)                   | 250,000   |
| Kill Bonus (Melee)                      | 300,000   |
| Conceded before round 5                 | -50,000   |
| Intentionally targeted an ejected pilot | -120,000  |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

### Weight Class Multipliers

All of the rewards listed above have been calculated for the light weight class. For matches played in higher weight classes, rewards should be modified using the below table:

| Weight Class | Modifier |
| :---         | :---:   |
| Medium       | 1.25    |
| Heavy        | 1.50    |
| Assault      | 2.00    |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

### Repair BattleMech's

After each arena fight, BattleMechs will sustain damage to their weapons and armour, as well as needing rearmament for depleted ammunition stores.

There is no need to account for spare parts or ammunition costs as these are assumed and covered under the administration costs.

Instead, repairs in MekHQ should be completed automatically, but funds should be subtracted from the stable’s accounts using the following formula:

`Total repair cost = (Mech Tonnage x 1000) x Damage State Modifier x Clan tech? x Tech Skill Modifier`
{: .bg-white.rounded.border.p-2 }

The Clan Tech modifier is ignored if that `Mech’s technical staff has the ‘Clan Tech Knowledge’ SPA.

| Type of Modifier/Level of Modifier  | Modifier Number |
| :---                              | :---:          |
| **Damage State**                  |                |
| Light Damage                      | 1.20           |
| Moderate Damage                   | 1.50           |
| Heavy Damage                      | 1.80           |
| Crippled                          | 2.25           |
| Cored/Engine Destruction          | 3.00           |
| Ammo Explosion                    | 5.00           |
| **Clan Tech?**                    |                |
| Yes                               | 1.25           |
| No                                | 1.00           |
| Clan Tech Knowledge (Per Mech)    | 1.00           |
| **Tech SKill**                    |                |
| Green                             | 1.20           |
| Regular                           | 1.00           |
| Veteran                           | 0.80           |
| Elite                             | 0.50           |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

N.B – These costs are kept relatively low for game reasons to prevent a stable which loses a mech in its first match to catastrophic damage from being totally out of the game.

### Pilot Injury/Death

Pilots may sustain injuries, or in severe cases, die in the cockpit during the Solaris Games, although competition medics and stables will often do their best to prevent this. The low-power show munitions used during Solaris matches contribute to pilot survival but are still incredibly dangerous.

Any pilot receiving 3 or fewer hits during a match recovers fully after the match.

Any pilot receiving 4 or more hits should roll on the below table using 2d6 + any modifiers. Stables may spend multiples of 100,000 C-Bills to get a +1 bonus to their dice roll, up to a bonus of +5.

A pilot with 4 or 5 hits who fails the target number is crippled – they have lost a limb or sustained a severe injury. They must sit out the next two weeks whilst they recover and are fitted with a prosthetic.

A pilot who suffered 6 hits (i.e., ‘killed’) is permanently dead if they roll below their target number, otherwise they should be treated as crippled.

| Number of Hits                | Target Number     |
| :---:                         | :---:             |
| 4                             | 5+                |
| 5                             | 7+                |
| 6 (killed)                    | 10+               |
| **Modifier**                   | **Bonus/Penalty** |
| Ejected Pilot Shot/Stepped On | -5                |
| Cockpit Destroyed             | -4                |
| Ammunition Explosion          | -2                |
| Engine Destruction            | -1                |
| Per 100,000 C-Bills           | +1                |
| Conceded/'Mech Not Destroyed  | +2                |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

## Stable Management

### Paying Wages & Admin Costs

The paying of pilot and tech salaries should be handled by MekHQ. Salaries are paid weekly. Salaries should be set as follows:

| Role                | Weekly Salary |
| :---                | :---:         |
| **MechWarrior**     |               |
| Green               | 1,500         |
| Regular             | 3,000         |
| Veteran             | 5,000         |
| Elite               | 10,000        |
| **Technical Staff** |               |
| Green               | 1,400         |
| Regular             | 2,800         |
| Veteran             | 4,500         |
| Elite               | 8,500         |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

#### Administration Costs

Administration costs represent the outgoings to keep the staff of the stable fed and housed, from the MechWarriors down to the Astechs and office staff. It also represents the bribes, license fees, and other miscellanea needed for a stable to operate on the games world.

Administration costs are paid weekly, and should be calculated using the following formula:

`Admin Cost = (Total stable tonnage x 1000) x (Total no. of mechwarriors & techs / 2) x 1.25`
{: .bg-white.rounded.border.p-2 }

e.g. a stable with a single 35 ton Firestarter, 3 MechWarriors, and 1 tech would pay 87,500 C-Bills per week in administration costs.

### Bankruptcy and Loans

A stable is considered bankrupt when it does not have the funds to pay its wages/admin costs, or a repair cost for its only BattleMech at the end of a week.

A bankrupt stable may take out a loan to keep itself afloat. Only one loan may be taken out at any one time.

If the stable already has a loan and becomes bankrupt again, it is in default and the stable is closed by repossession agents. The player should roll up a new stable.

Loans can be taken out in the following amounts, with associated interest payments:

| Loan Value | Term / Weekly Repayment |
| :---       | :---:                   |
| 1,000,000  | 8 Weeks / 135,000       |
| 2,500,000  | 16 Weeks / 180,000      |
| 5,000,000  | 24 Weeks / 230,000      |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

### Pilot Management

#### Earning Renown – Star MechWarriors

Whilst the stable is the holder of the license, the machinery, and the means of competing, it is the MechWarriors the crowds come to see. As MechWarriors compete in matches they will earn renown points which contribute to their stable’s fame.

The crowds of Solaris are fickle however and can quickly find new heroes to cheer on, so MechWarriors must work hard to remain in the limelight.

Each pilot accumulates renown based on their actions. This renown pot is unique to each pilot and cannot be shared or transferred between pilots. Renown stays with a MechWarrior if they change stables. Whilst renown can be lost due to actions, it can never go below 0.

Renown is earned and lost after each battle using the following table:

| Condition                 | Renown Earned/Lost |
| :---                      | :---:              |
| Conceded before round 5   | -2                 |
| Attacked ejected pilot    | -3                 |
| Per match not played      | -1                 |
| Won regular match         | 2                  |
| Won exhibition/Team Match | 1                  |
| Kill (melee)              | 2                  |
| Kill (shooting)           | 1                  |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

#### Grudges and Rivalries

As pilots compete in the high stakes arenas of Solaris 7, they can build grudges and rivalries with other pilots. These are personal to the MechWarriors involved, and their grudge points are retained if they change stable.

Grudge points are not gained during seed matches.

Grudge points are gained using the below table:

| Condition                              | Grudge Points Earned/Lost |
| :---                                   | :---:                     |
| Per match fought vs. other MechWarrior | 1                         |
| Cockpit Destroyed                      | 3                         |
| MechWarrior targeted outside of 'mech  | 5                         |
| End of season                          | -3                        |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

#### Pilot Training

Between matches, pilots may buy simulator time to increase one of their skills. There is no guarantee that they will improve, so the stable’s investment may be lost.

A pilot may only buy simulator time for one skill per week.

The player should pick a skill they are trying to advance for the MechWarrior, invest the appropriate cost from the table, and then roll on the table below using 2d6. If the target number for the skill level is beaten, the pilot improves that skill to the next level.

| Gunnery  | Investment / TN | Piloting | Investment / TN |
| :---     | :---:           | :---     | :---:           |
| 6+ -> 5+ | 30,000 / 4+     | 6+ -> 5+ | 20,000 / 3+     |
| 5+ -> 4+ | 50,000 / 6+     | 5+ -> 4+ | 40,000 / 5+     |
| 4+ -> 3+ | 100,000 / 8+    | 4+ -> 3+ | 80,000 / 7+     |
| 3+ -> 2+ | 200,000 / 10+   | 3+ -> 2+ | 150,000 / 9+    |
| 2+ -> 1+ | 350,000 / 12+   | 2+ -> 1+ | 300,000 / 11+   |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

#### Buying New SPAs

Any pilot who increases a skill level below 3+ may also buy a new SPA, using the cost table provided at stable creation.

#### Sacking Pilots

Pilots may be sacked at any time, either to save money or because they have received crippling injuries which put them out of action. When a player wishes to sack a MechWarrior, they must do the following:

1. Pay out a redundancy payment using the below table.
2. Make the pilot’s details available to all other players in the tournament, including any details of injuries and renown accumulated.
3. Other stable masters may choose to hire the sacked pilot at 50% of their base cost (using the rules from stable creation).
4. If no other stable master chooses to hire the pilot by the end of the week, they are gone forever.

| Pilot Skill Level | Redundancy Payment |
| :---              | :---:              |
| Green             | Weekly Salary x 4  |
| Regular           | Weekly Salary x 5  |
| Veteran           | Weekly Salary x 6  |
| Elite             | Weekly Salary x 8  |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

### Buying New ‘Mechs/Customizing ‘Mechs

New ‘Mechs may be bought at any point in a season, using the rules from stable creation. ‘Mechs may also be customized at any point in the season using the rules from stable creation. Full costs must be paid. Like at stable creation, a new MechTech must be hired for each ‘mech purchased.

### Selling BattleMechs

A stable may choose to sell a BattleMech at any point in a season but must always have at least one ‘mech on its roster. A stable cannot exist without a BattleMech.

The process for selling a battlemech is as follows:

1. Make the ‘Mech’s details available to all other players in the tournament, including any details of damage levels.
2. Other stable masters have a 1-week period in which to place bids for the ‘mech to purchase it if they wish.
3. If no other stable master chooses to purchase the ‘Mech by the end of the week, the ‘mech is sold on the open market for 60% of the price listed in MekHQ.

### New Pilots

New pilots may be purchased at any point in the season, using the rules from stable creation. Full costs must be paid.

### Ending a Season/Starting a New Season

A season ends once the final regular matches have been played on both the regular and runners-up ladders.

### MechWarrior Transfers

Similar to many more traditional sports leagues, the Solaris stables have an open ‘transfer’ window at the end of a season.

Instead of sacking MechWarriors to remove them from the roster, a stable may choose to put their contract up for sale, or for loan.

#### Sale of MechWarrior Contracts

A MechWarrior’s contract may be placed on the ‘For Sale’ market at the end of the season. The player wishing to sell a MechWarrior should do the following:

1. Make the MechWarrior’s details publicly available to other players, including skill levels, SPAs, renown, grudges, and any injuries.
2. List a desired price for the MechWarrior’s contract.
3. Other players may then place bids to purchase the MechWarrior; the player may choose to accept any one bid, negotiate these, or refuse all bids.
4. If a bid is accepted, the MechWarrior’s contract is sold to the bidding player, the MechWarrior is added to their roster, and removed from the selling player’s roster.

#### Loan of MechWarriors

A MechWarrior may be offered for loan to other players at the end of the season. A loan is a temporary transfer of a MechWarrior to another stable, lasting one season. At the end of the loan period, the MechWarrior should be returned to their original stable with any new skill levels, SPAs, and renown or grudge points carried over.

During the period of the loan the borrowing stable is responsible for the salary and any training costs for the MechWarrior and any associated increases to their administration costs as a result.

A stable wishing to make a MechWarrior available for loan should do the following:

1. Make the MechWarrior’s details publicly available to other players, including skill levels, SPAs, renown, grudges, and any injuries.
2. List a desired price or weekly fee for the loan of the MechWarrior.
3. Other players may then place bids to take the MechWarrior on loan; the player may choose to accept any one bid, negotiate these, or refuse all bids.
4. If a bid is accepted, the MechWarrior is loaned to the bidding player, added to their roster, and removed from the original player’s roster.
5. At the end of the loan period, the mechwarrior is returned to the original player.
6. The player who borrowed the MechWarrior may make an offer to purchase the MechWarrior’s contract, even if it is not for sale. The original stable is not obligated to accept this offer.

### Fame

As stables complete seasons on Solaris, they gain fame (or infamy!) for their successes and failures in the arena. Fame is tracked via Fame Points.

Players should keep a track of the fame points accumulated by their stable and use these to apply modifiers in the below tables for inter-season funding.

As well as fame points accumulated by the stable, the total pilot renown of all pilots on the roster should also be added to the fame points total.

#### Accumulating Fame Points

Fame points are tallied using the table below:

| Condition                                                                           | Number of Fame Points Awarded |
| :---                                                                                | :---:                         |
| Won the Regular Ladder                                                              | 5                             |
| Won the Runners Up Ladder                                                           | 3                             |
| Most Kills (Awarded to the stable with the highest total kills across all pilots.)  | 2                             |
| Participated in a season                                                            | 1                             |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

Fame points are additive – for example, a stable which won the regular ladder final match, had the most kills out of all participating stables, and participated in a season would receive 8 Fame Points, plus the total of their pilots’ renown.

### Inter-season Funding

#### Licensing, Merchandising & Broadcast Rights

As well as the tournament prizes, stables survive on lucrative licensing, merchandising, and broadcasting rights deals. The c-bills earned in this section represent everything from branded clothing with the stable’s logo to collectible miniatures of the ‘Mechs used by star pilots, to exclusive deals with vidcasters and recording firms.

To calculate rights earnings, roll a 3d6 on the following table, adding the total number of fame points as bonus to the dice roll:

| Dice Roll | Earnings    |
| :---      | :---:       |
| 2 - 6     | 1,000,000   |
| 7 - 12    | 1,500,000   |
| 13 - 20   | 2,500,000   |
| 21 - 30   | 5,000,000   |
| 31 - 50   | 10,000,000  |
| 51 - 80   | 15,000,000  |
| 81 - 100  | 20,000,000  |
| 101+      | 25,000,000  |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

#### Outside Investment

Between seasons, stable masters may seek outside investment in their stable, perhaps through advertising and sponsorship deals, stocks and shares, or lump sums. These investors will expect returns for their money.

If players wish to seek outside investment, they should roll 2d6 on the below table. A player may pick any outside investment option from the bracket they rolled, or from any lower bracket. This represents their negotiating position.

| Total Roll  | Amount Received | Conditions                                              |
| :---        | :---:           | ---:                                                    |
| 2 - 4       | 2,500,000       | Place 2nd or better in a seed match.                    |
| 7 - 12      | 5,000,000       | Place 1st in a seed match OR win your 1st ladder match  |
| 13 - 20     | 10,000,000      | Reach the Quarter Finals on any ladder or better        |
| 21 - 30     | 15,000,000      | Reach the Semi-Finals on the regular ladder             |
| 31 - 50     | 20,000,000      | Win the final match of the regular ladder                |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

If a player rolls for outside investment, they do not have to pick the investment and can walk away from the deal if they so choose.

#### Failing to Meet Investor Conditions

If a stable accepts outside investment and fails to meet the conditions placed upon it by its investors it must do the following:

1. Repay 50% of the amount received.
2. Not apply for outside investment in the next season.

After one season without outside investment has passed, the player may seek outside investment again.

### Competition Licenses

If stables have earned enough during a season, and from their inter-season funding, they may choose to buy-in to additional weight classes. There is no limit to the number of weight classes a stable may compete in.

To buy into a new weight class, there must be a minimum of four stables in the player group with the funding to buy-in and purchase a ‘mech of the selected class.

Purchasing a competition license for a weight class costs the following:

| Class   | Cost    |
| :---    | :---:   |
| Light   | 25,000  |
| Medium  | 50,000  |
| Heavy   | 75,000  |
| Assault | 100,000 |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

Once a competition license has been purchased it is held indefinitely. A license is only lost if a stable sells its last BattleMech in that weight class e.g., a stable with 2 lights and 1 medium ‘mech sells its medium ‘mech, losing the right to compete in the medium weight class.

If a license is lost in this way, it must be repurchased before the stable can compete in that weight class again.

### Staff, Bonuses, & Retirement

#### Pay Rises

At the end of each season, MechWarriors and techs should receive a 5% increase to their salary e.g., an elite MechWarrior survives their first season. Their weekly salary is increased to 10,500.

#### Staff Bonuses

At the end of each season, a stable can choose to pay out a cash bonus to any of their staff. If a cash bonus is paid, no retirement roll is needed.

Cash bonuses are calculated using the following table:

| Skill Level | Bonus Amount  |
| :---        | :---:         |
| Green       | 25,000        |
| Regular     | 50,000        |
| Veteran     | 100,000       |
| Elite       | 250,000       |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

#### Retirement

If a staff member was not paid a bonus, the player must make a retirement roll for them. Roll a 2d6 on the below table:

| Roll  | Staff Member Retires |
| :---: | :---:                |
| 2 - 4 | Yes                  |
| 5 +   | No                   |
{: .table.table-hover.table-striped }

A stable master may choose to pay a bonus to a retiring member of staff at this stage to keep them.

If a bonus is paid after a staff member has chosen to retire, the bonus to be paid out should be multiplied by 2.

E.g., an elite MechWarrior rolls a 2 on the retirement table. The player wishes to keep them, so must pay a bonus of 500,000 c-bills to prevent the retirement.
