          “Good morning ‘mech fans – welcome to another beautiful day in Solaris City. We’re live today from one of Solaris’ newest arenas: Island Intercept. I’ll be providing the blow by blow for this, the very first seed match of the MegaMek Invitational.”

          “Here we go, folks! Five `Mechs and one no-show for this one. We’ve got four in the corners and what looks like a converted industrial ‘mech on the island being moved into place via the underground lift. That is one of the one’s to watch – all the way from the planet of New Maryland and paid for by taxpayer money. Hope they get their moneys’ worth!”

          “There goes the starter horn – we’ve got three `Mechs on the island now. What’s this? The Hellas Basin Rollers Raven is retreating back onto its deployment lift to escape the New Maryland monster – the crowd’s booing that pilot now. This is Solaris, we want to see some action!”

          “Pieter Mayhew’s Raven is mixing it up with the UrbanMech on the north side of the island, and it’s not going Pieter’s way – his SRMs go sailing off into the sea! That Urbie’s packing a heck of a lot of pulse lasers, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he rips that Raven apart in the next few minutes. Not much action to speak of down south, so all eyes are on this first duel.”

          “It’s really hotting up down there, `Mech fans! Mayhew’s trying his best to run from that Urbie but it looks like he’s taken some hits to the legs – they’re about the same speed now. Oh! That must’ve hurt – the Raven goes down.”

          “Whilst that industrial ‘mech pushes out of the water, we’re seeing a lot of action between the Werebears’ Firestarter and the other Raven on the field. SRMs are flying here folks and… Oh! That’s a big hit – the Firestarter is going hand to hand with the Raven and that last hit completely caved in some of that reflective armour! Another Raven goes down – bad luck for that pilot.”

          “The action keeps coming here at the Island, folks. MingLee’s Urbie has finished up with Mayhew’s Raven and is stomping on down south now. The Werebears’ Firestarter decided to leave the Flicker alone and focus on the New Maryland Demolisher – it’s not gone his way though and he’s on the ground now too!”

          “It’s all over for the Werebears now folks – with a leg gone and being wailed on by a sword no less, he had no chance of getting up, that pilot’s decided to punch out! Careful of shrapnel down there, little guy. MingLee’s Urbie is coming in for the kill on the hurting Demolisher now and the lasers are flying down there! I can’t tell if I’m watching a Solaris match or a disco show in downtown.”

          “And that about wraps it up, folks. The UrbanMech takes the prize, claiming two destroyed up close and personal (and boy, was it personal! He sure stamped the Hellas Basin Rollers’ Raven) and clean shooting kill on the New Maryland Demolisher. Stay tuned tomorrow, for more ‘mech action from this exciting new series. I’ve been your host, Duncan Fisher.”
