          "Good evening, 'mech fans - Duncan Fisher here, and welcome to 3062! Hope you've worked off your new year hangovers because boy, do we have something exciting coming up. A new tournament has sprung up here on Solaris and it promises to have all the action you could want; we'd like to welcome the eighteen new stables of the MegaMek Invitational to the games world. Hope you've brought your c-bills, because it's going to get messy!"

          *Papers can be heard audibly rustling on the broadcast as well as ice rattling against glass.*

          "For the start of this new season, we're going to be seeing some of the best light 'mech action around. Before we get to the championship though, we're going to be seeing a taste of what's to come via the three seed matches. These are going to tell us who these hotshots end up facing in their first round so stay tuned - if you want to know the betting odds, make sure you're watching these three matches!"

          *More rustling can be heard, as well as a long pause as Duncan takes a drink.*

          "So join me, Duncan Fisher, for each match of this new tournament season!"

          *The microphone stays live for a few moments more. Duncan can be heard getting out of his chair.*
