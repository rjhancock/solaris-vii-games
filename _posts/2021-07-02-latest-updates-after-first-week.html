          "Thanks for joining us on SBC Breakfast. Now to our sports correspondent, Duncan Fisher, for all the latest on the arenas. Duncan."

          "Thanks, Chris. It's been a hell of a week for Solaris, 'mech fans. If you like watching twelve metre monsters batter the plates off each other, the MegaMek Invitational has exceeded expectations. We've seen a lot of matches so far and a few upsets along with them."

          "Just yesterday we saw the first pilot death of the season here in the Steiner Stadium, with Pieter Mayhew of Mayhew's Mayhems getting fried in his cockpit by pulse lasers in his first match, no less. We've also seen a real trend towards 'Mechs built for in-close melee action and 'Mechs built out of some of the shiniest armour I've ever seen to keep those deadly energy arrays at bay. Coming up on Saturday, we're expecting to see the first lance on lance match of the season, with eight 'Mechs slugging it out on the field at once. It's going to be a real show."

          *Duncan sways a little on the spot.*
