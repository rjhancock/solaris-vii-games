          "... with no sign of tensions lessening between Davion and Steiner supporters on Solaris, and a turbulent political landscape, who knows what will come next for the Inner Sphere? Collaterlie Sisters for SBC News, good night."

          "Collaterlie, thanks. That was the six o'clock news for the Solaris Broadcasting Company. I've been your host, Chris. Before we go the seven o'clock mercenary drama, 'The Archers', we have time for some sport. Duncan, remind us what's happened this week."

          "Thanks Chris, and good evening 'mech fans. The first week of the MegaMek Invitational has been a real show, folks. We've seen two pilots get hosed out of their cockpits; first Pieter Mayhew, then Arseny Sabovich in the lance on lance. The action has been blistering - we've had a match almost every day this week and they've all been a real treat. As this newer series is still picking up speed, next week will be the quarter-finals round for both the championship and the runners-up."

          *Duncan can be heard lighting a cigar with a flip-top lighter.*

          "Join me next week, 'mech fans, for more explosive 'mech on 'mech action. This is Duncan Fisher for SBC news, signing off."
