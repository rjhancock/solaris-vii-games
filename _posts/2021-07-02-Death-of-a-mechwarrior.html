          Jaasim Khaled watched the still smoking Raven be transported into the ‘mech bays of the Steiner Stadium with mixed feelings. Had he just watched his boss die? He’d been up in the stands to watch the game, had watched Pieter struggle to bring the ‘mech to its feet, stagger back into the centre of the neo-classical pillar, only for the much quicker Commando to come up the wall behind it and unleash a fearsome blast of laser fire. Those rapid-fire bursts of coherent light had smashed into the fragile cockpit glass and sensor screens of the Raven’s sleek, aerospace-fighteresque torso-mounted cockpit before breaking through in a cloud of melting armour and glass. The bursts had poured into the ‘Mech’s chest and it had fallen forwards, smoke billowing from what had been the cockpit.
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          The crowd had gone wild. This is what they had come to see; brutal fights between BattleMechs', and they were not disappointed.
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          Khaled levered himself up onto the salvage truck bed along with Jaimee, the stable’s chief tech. Jaimee ran a grease-stained hand through her short hair and gave him a quick look.
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          “What do you reckon, Jelly?” There was a distinct edge to her voice.
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          “Don’t know, Jaimee, but it won’t be good. Get a ladder.”
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          They climbed up onto the torso of the Raven, going hand over hand up the scarred armour plate until they were standing on the lip of the cockpit, looking down into its charred maw. Brushing away a layer of fire-suppressant foam sprayed at the ‘mech by the salvage crews, he pulled a torch from his belt and flicked it on, probing the darkness.
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          The harsh yellow beam of the torch settled on the command chair and Khaled inhaled sharply. Pieter was still there, strapped into his command chair, a charred ruin of a man in the burned remains of a cooling vest and a shattered neurohelmet. His hands were still gripping the controls with a vice-like grip, mangled fingers squeezing firing triggers. All around him, the cockpit was a twisted and broken mess, life-support systems leaking fluid, screens shattered or broken free from mountings and thrown about the cockpit like shrapnel.
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          “Fuck.”
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          Khaled fumbled for a pack of cigarettes and lit one, unable to tear his eyes away from the remains of his old boss. They had come out of the fighting in St. Ives to find fame and fortune on Solaris. Pieter had found a grave.
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          Jaimee reached for the pack of cigarettes and snatched it out of his hand, lighting her own, before leaning over the side of the Raven to be sick.
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          “We’d better get him out of there, Jaimee.”
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          “Give me a minute.” The usually unflappable ‘tech was decidedly pale.
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          Khaled scrambled down off the Raven’s torso, finishing his cigarette, and flicking it away onto the ferrocrete below the truck. Jaimee joined him a minute later, gesturing at her teams of astechs to start releasing the crippled BattleMech from the salvage truck.
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          “So, what do we now, Jelly?”
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          “We’re still on the runners-up ladder and we’ve got an exhibition in a few hours. We get him out of there, we put enough of a cockpit back in for me to ride, and we keep going.”
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          The tech regarded him with a raised eyebrow. “That’s cold. You can’t expect to ride that thing today?”
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          “And pay the forfeiture fees for our exhibition over at the Mesas? We’re going to need every c-bill we can get, Jaimee. Get on it with your crews and get that thing into a pilotable state.” Khaled lit another cigarette, inhaling deep.
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          “Yeah, alright. What’re you gonna do?”
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          “Register a name change. ‘Mayhew’s Mayhems’ is as dead as the man who founded it. From this moment on, we’re ‘Khaled’s Killers’.”
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          Jaimee’s eyebrows crawled further towards the top of her forehead, before she shrugged in resignation.
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          “You’re the boss, I suppose.”
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          As Khaled walked away over the ferrocrete to the promoter’s office to collect their participation fee, he could just make out Jaimee’s whispered “Fucking mercenaries.”.
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          Khaled smiled; he had a ‘mech again.
